# Scratchpad Usage

This directory holds temporary working notes for active tasks.

## Lifecycle

1. **Create:** When starting a complex task, create `/context/pad/{{task-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`

2. **Work:** Use this file for intermediate calculations, debugging notes, context assembly

3. **Promote or Discard:** After task completion:
   - If contains important facts → Extract to `/context/memory/fact/`
   - If contains valuable session context → Summarize to `/context/memory/episodic/`
   - If purely temporary → Delete

## Promotion Rules

- Facts that will be referenced in future sessions → `/context/memory/fact/`
- Session summaries and outcomes → `/context/memory/episodic/`
- Everything else → Delete after task completion
